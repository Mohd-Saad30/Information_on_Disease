            <h2>What is Diabetes</h2>
            <p>
                Diabetes mellitus is a condition associated with high blood sugar levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a healthy person consumes carbohydrates, the body breaks them down and absorbs them from the gut as sugar. Additionally, the liver also makes sugar. Sugar is taken up by the cells of our body and used to generate energy.
                Insulin is the hormone which allows sugar to be taken up by body cells.
            </p>
            <p>
                In diabetes, the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin. The body may also be unable to use insulin effectively (this condition is termed insulin resistance). These lead to high blood sugar levels.
            </p>

            <h2>Why treat Diabetes?</h2>
            <p>
                High blood sugar is harmful to the body. Over time, high blood sugar damages the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Individuals living with diabetes are also at higher risk of heart attacks and strokes.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, diabetes-related complications can be prevented with proper care. You can reduce your risk of developing complications by making healthy changes to your lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>Some examples of healthy living habits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eating a healthy diet</li>
                <li>Staying active and maintaining a healthy body weight</li>
                <li>Taking your medications regularly to help keep blood sugar levels normal</li>
                <li>Maintaining your blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels in the healthy range</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition, your doctor will arrange for you to undergo regular screening of your eyes, feet, and kidneys. This will detect complications early, allowing for timely intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                With appropriate care and management, many individuals with diabetes go on to enjoy long and fulfilling lives.

            <h2>Common Types of Diabetes</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>
                    Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It arises when the body becomes resistant to its own insulin. In addition, the pancreas may also make insufficient insulin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Type 2 Diabetes can be managed with a combination of healthy eating, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and medications.
                </p>

                <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>
                    Type 1 diabetes develops when the body's immune system destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leads to insulin deficiency. Without insulin, blood sugar levels become dangerously high and can lead to a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, but it can also develop later in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes will need insulin injections to manage their condition.

        <h1>Knee Replacement</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>Knee replacement, also known as knee arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure to replace the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. It is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and also for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or trauma.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>The treatment involves removing damaged cartilage and bone from the knee joint and replacing it with an artificial joint made of metal alloys, high-grade plastics, and polymers. The procedure helps restore function and reduce pain in the knee.</p>
            <p>There are two main types of knee replacement surgeries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Knee Replacement (TKR):</strong> Involves replacing both sides of the knee joint.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Knee Replacement (PKR):</strong> Involves replacing only one side of the knee joint, which is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rehabilitation and physical therapy are crucial after the surgery to regain strength and mobility in the knee.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Curability</h2>
            <p>Knee replacement surgery is highly effective in relieving pain and improving mobility for patients suffering from severe knee joint damage. While it does not restore the knee to its original state, it significantly enhances the quality of life for most patients.</p>
            <p>Most patients experience long-term relief, with artificial joints lasting 15-20 years or more depending on activity levels and overall health. However, in some cases, revision surgery may be required if the artificial joint wears out or complications arise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Risks and Complications</h2>
            <p>As with any surgical procedure, knee replacement surgery carries some risks, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Infection</li>
                <li>Blood clots</li>
                <li>Nerve or blood vessel damage</li>
                <li>Stiffness or reduced range of motion</li>
                <li>Loosening or wear of the artificial joint over time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to discuss these risks with your doctor and follow post-operative care instructions to minimize complications.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who is a Candidate?</h2>
            <p>Knee replacement surgery is typically recommended for individuals who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have severe knee pain or stiffness that limits daily activities.</li>
                <li>Experience chronic inflammation and swelling that does not improve with rest or medication.</li>
                <li>Have significant knee joint damage visible on X-rays.</li>
                <li>Have not responded to other treatments such as physical therapy, medications, or injections.</li>
            </ul>

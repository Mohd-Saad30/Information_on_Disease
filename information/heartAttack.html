                A heart attack occurs when an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart is blocked. Fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits build up over time, forming plaques in the heart's arteries. 
                If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. The clot can block arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, a lack of blood flow causes the tissue in the heart muscle to die.

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing, or aching</li>
                <li>Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth, or sometimes the upper belly</li>
                <li>Cold sweat</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Heartburn or indigestion</li>
                <li>Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness</li>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Women may have atypical symptoms such as brief or sharp pain felt in the neck, arm, or back. Sometimes, the first symptom of a heart attack is sudden cardiac arrest.

                Some heart attacks strike suddenly. But many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days, or weeks in advance. Chest pain or pressure (angina) that keeps happening and doesn't go away with rest may be an early warning sign.
                Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart.

            <h2>How is a Heart Attack Treated?</h2>
            <p>
                Treating a heart attack means restoring blood flow to the affected heart muscle as soon as possible. This can happen in a variety of ways, ranging from medication to surgery. Treatment will likely include several of the following methods:

                <h3>Supplementary Oxygen</h3>
                <p>
                    People having trouble breathing or with low blood oxygen levels often receive supplementary oxygen along with other heart attack treatments. You can breathe the oxygen either through a tube that sits just below your nose or a mask that fits over your nose and mouth. This increases the amount of oxygen circulating in your blood and reduces the strain on your heart.

                <h3>Medications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anti-clotting medications:</strong> Includes aspirin and other blood-thinning medicines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitroglycerin:</strong> Relieves chest pain and causes blood vessels to widen so blood can pass through more easily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thrombolytic (clot-busting) medications:</strong> Used only within the first 12 hours after a heart attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antiarrhythmia medications:</strong> Prevent or stop malfunctions in your heartâ€™s normal beating rhythm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain medications:</strong> Morphine is commonly used to alleviate chest pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Beta-blockers:</strong> Help slow down your heart rate so your heart can recover.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antihypertensives:</strong> Decrease blood pressure and aid recovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statins:</strong> Stabilize plaque in blood vessels, reduce cholesterol, and lower the risk of another heart attack.</li>
